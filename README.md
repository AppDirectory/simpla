# Simpla

Simpla is a collection of new dynamic HTML elements you can use anywhere. Drop them into your code, then edit their content permanently on your site any time. They look like this:

```markup
<simpla-text sid="text" placeholder="Enter your text"></simpla-text>

<simpla-img sid="img" class="my-img"></simpla-img>
```

The elements run entirely on the frontend and can be used in any stack or framework. Only their content is editable, so your code stays terse and secure. All editing is done inline, and there's no predefined logic or structure. There's nothing to setup or install, just include a single JavaScript file to enable the new elements.
